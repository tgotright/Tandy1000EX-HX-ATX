# Tandy1000EX-HX-ATX
Drop in replacement Power Supply board for Tandy 1000 EX and HX computers. 

Readme+Bill of Materials

This is a drop in replacement board that allows you to use an ATX power supply, preferrably a Pico PSU. No need to destroy the factory harness, it's plug and play. 
Even the factory switch can be used by running wires to the appropriate pads on the board. 
It is up to the user to decide where they drill the case for the DC jack. 
The items in the BoM can be substituted for similar items
	the Tandy Pin header must at least have a pitch of 3.98mm
	Any ATX connector can be used. 20 pin or 24, stright or right angle. Right angle is encouraged so the Tandy's rear fan can pull heat from the Pico PSU more easilly.
